  <h1>MyCoolClass (2020–2025)</h1>

  <p>
    MyCoolClass was a global teacher-owned platform cooperative, building a democratic alternative to commercial online teaching platforms.
    At its height, it connected hundreds of ESL teachers and learners across continents.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the cooperative has now concluded its activities, this page remains as an archive, a tribute, and a reminder of what educators can build—together, beyond markets.
